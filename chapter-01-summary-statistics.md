# 📊 Statistics 101: A Practical Overview

## 🔍 What is Statistics?

**Statistics** is the science of collecting, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data.  
It helps us make sense of the world through numbers.

### Two Main Branches:
- **Descriptive Statistics** – Summarize or describe features of a dataset.
- **Inferential Statistics** – Make predictions or inferences about a population based on a sample.


## 📈 Why Statistics Matter

Stats are everywhere—sports, finance, healthcare, government, science.  
They answer real-world questions like:
- What’s the average salary?
- Do ads affect purchases?
- Is a new vaccine effective?


## ⚠️ Limitations of Statistics

- Only answers **measurable, well-defined** questions.
- Tells you **what** is happening and **how often**, not **why** it’s happening.



## 🔢 Types of Data

### **Numeric Data**
- **Continuous**: Infinite values within a range (e.g., stock prices).
- **Interval/Count**: Whole numbers (e.g., cups of coffee per day).

### **Categorical Data**
- **Nominal**: No natural order (e.g., eye color, brands).
- **Ordinal**: Ordered categories (e.g., satisfaction ratings).

## 📊 Data Visualization

Visuals help explore and communicate insights. Pick the right chart for your data type:

| Chart Type | Purpose                                    | Data Type   | Best For                                           | Example                          |
|------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Bar Chart  | Compare values across **categories**       | Categorical | Highlighting highs/lows, discrete comparisons      | Sales by product type            |
| Histogram  | Show the **distribution** of data          | Continuous  | Detecting skew, peaks, and spread                  | Age distribution in a population |
| Box Plot   | Show spread & **identify outliers**        | Continuous  | Comparing distributions across groups              | Salary ranges by department      |

## 📍 Measures of Center

These help find the “typical” value in your dataset:

- **Mean** – Arithmetic average
- **Median** – Middle value
- **Mode** – Most frequent value

### 🧠 Use the **Mean** when:
- Data is **symmetric** (bell-shaped).
- You care about **all values** equally.
- There are **no extreme outliers**.

📌 _Example_: Average test score in a balanced classroom.

### 🤔 Use the **Median** when:
- Data is **skewed** (e.g., income, housing prices).
- You want a **typical** value that’s not affected by outliers.

📌 _Example_: Median income in a city with billionaires and broke students.

### 😎 Use the **Mode** when:
- Data is **categorical** or **discrete**.
- You're looking for the **most common** value.
- You have **bimodal/multimodal** data.

📌 _Example_: Most popular ice cream flavor.



### 🧪 Quick Test:

| Scenario                    | Best Measure |
|----------------------------|--------------|
| No outliers, symmetric     | Mean         |
| Outliers or skewed data    | Median       |
| Categorical or most frequent | Mode       |

## 🌊 Measures of Spread

These describe how **spread out** or **varied** the data is:

- **Range** = Max − Min  
- **Variance** = Average of squared deviations from the mean  
- **Standard Deviation (SD)** = Square root of variance  
- **Quartiles & IQR (Interquartile Range)**:
  - Divides data into four equal parts
  - **IQR = Q3 − Q1** → Helps avoid distortion from outliers
